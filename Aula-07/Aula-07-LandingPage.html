          <h2>Hello, I’m Natan, a Fullstack Development student.</h2>
          <p>
            I’m not someone who has all the answers — but I try. I try to
            understand, to solve my problems, even when it feels like I’m moving
            in circles. My personality is shaped by curiosity, reflection, and
            persistence, even when I doubt myself. I’ve spent time exploring not
            just my strengths, but also my fears and contradictions. I
            understand I don’t need to be perfect — I just need to keep going,
            to keep trying. What motivates me is the process itself: trying to
            make sense of things, trying to build, trying to become better. I’m
            often caught between overthinking and acting, but I’m learning to
            trust that small steps matter. I value authenticity and depth. I’m
            not interested in looking like I have it all together; I’d rather be
            honest about where I’m at — someone in progress. This website is a
            reflection of that: my journey, my experiments, my attempts. Not a
            finished product, but a work in motion.
