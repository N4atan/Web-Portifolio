# [🌐 Personal Portfolio - Natan Gabriel Wildner da Silva](https://n4atan.github.io/UC12-Portfolio/)

Welcome to my personal portfolio! This is a simple and responsive website built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It's a place to showcase my projects, my skills, and a little about myself as I grow as a developer.
